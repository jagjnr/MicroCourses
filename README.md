# MicroCourses: Front-End Web Development Project

Welcome to the **MicroCourses** project repository! This project was built as part of a Front-End Web Development course assessment. The website showcases a fictional online education platform offering a comprehensive Full Stack Data Scientist course.

## 🌐 Live Overview
MicroCourses is a responsive and accessible website designed to deliver a user-friendly learning experience. It features:

- A dynamic, engaging Home Page with a promotional video.
- A dedicated Courses Page with clickable course tiles.
- Individual Course Detail Pages with detailed descriptions, modules, and enrollment forms.
- A Contact Page with a functional form and embedded map.
